# Three populations analysed: ‘LAB’ Langdon Beck, ‘NENT’ River Nent and ‘ODN’ Odin’s mine.
# Two Sections to this project: 1- Demographic Analyses for an overview of the population relationships. 2- Selection Scans to detect any genes exhibiting natural selection.

# Demographic Analyses:
File used = reheadered_4dg_dips.clean_BI.ann.vcf
Three different scripts used for running this analysis:
1) Adgenet Script which produces a Principal Component Analysis of the three populations involved in this project.
2) Splitree Script which gives a rooted tree decribing the evolutionary relationships between the three populations.
3) FastStructure Script presentating another view at infering the population structures.

# Selection Scans:
File used = LAB_NEN_ODN.clean_BI.ann.vcf.gz
Two different approaches used for running the scans:
1) Python Approach which uses 5 different scripts from G1 to GS to calculate the FST, DXY, DD and AFD values of all populations and plot them against each other.
2) Scantools Approach which uses three different scripts - recode012.py, sian_bpm.py and Sian_sort_for_Scantools.py to create a file consisting of the populations along with their FST, DXY and AFD values. This file is then used in Rstudio with FST_DXY_Plot R Script to plot the AFD, FST and DXY values.

Scripts used for Demographic Analysis:
1. Adgenet Script.R 
2. Splittree Script.R
3. faststructure.sh

Scripts used for Selection Scans:
1. Python - G1_outliers.py, G2_genes.py, G3_graphs.py, G3_graphs_percentile.py and GS_classes.
2. Scantools - recode012.py, sian_bpm.py, Sian_sort_for_ScanTools.py and FST_DXY_Plot.R
